# CyberOide Backend Video Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hello, I'm Ali Hussnain, and today I'll be walking you through the backend architecture of the CyberOide Learning Platform, an online education system I developed using the MERN stack. Let me show you how it works."

## Architecture Overview (1 minute)
"The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Here's how it's structured:

- Models: MongoDB schemas using Mongoose for data structure
- Controllers: Business logic for handling requests
- Routes: API endpoint definitions
- Middleware: Authentication, authorization, and request validation
- Config: Database and third-party service connections

Let me walk you through each component."

## Folder Structure Demo (1 minute)
"Here's our project structure in VS Code. Let me navigate through the key folders:

- `/models`: Contains MongoDB schema definitions
- `/controllers`: Handles business logic
- `/routes`: Defines API endpoints
- `/middleware`: Includes authentication and validation
- `/config`: Contains database and third-party service connections

This clean separation of concerns makes the codebase maintainable and scalable."

## Database Models (1-2 minutes)
"Let's look at our database models. We have:

- `User.js`: Stores user accounts with roles (student, instructor, admin)
- `Course.js`: Contains course information and metadata
- `Purchase.js`: Tracks course enrollments and payment information
- `File.js`: Manages course content files metadata

Each model includes validation rules and relationships to other models. For example, the Course model references the User model for instructors."

## Authentication System (2 minutes)
"Security is critical for an e-learning platform. Let me show you our authentication system:

- User registration: Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage
- JWT-based authentication: Tokens are generated at login and verified on protected routes
- Role-based authorization: Different user types (student, instructor, admin) have different permissions

Here in `authController.js`, you can see how we:
1. Register users
2. Authenticate credentials
3. Generate secure JWT tokens
4. Implement middleware to protect routes"

## Course Management (2 minutes)
"Next, let's examine how courses are managed in `courseController.js`:

- Instructors can create and update courses
- Course materials are uploaded to Supabase storage
- Files are validated for type and size before upload
- Secure signed URLs are generated for authorized downloads

Here's the file upload logic using Multer and our Supabase integration."

## Payment Processing (2 minutes)
"For monetization, we integrate with Stripe in `checkoutController.js`:

- Checkout sessions are created when students purchase courses
- Webhook handlers process successful payments
- Purchase records are created upon payment completion
- Students gain access to course content automatically

Let me show you how the checkout flow works, from session creation to webhook handling."

## API Endpoints Demo (1-2 minutes)
"Now let's look at our API routes:

- `/api/auth`: Authentication endpoints
- `/api/courses`: Course management endpoints
- `/api/checkout`: Payment processing
- `/api/webhook`: Stripe webhook handler

Each route is connected to its respective controller, maintaining clean separation of concerns."

## Error Handling & Security (1 minute)
"We've implemented robust error handling throughout the application:

- Centralized error handling middleware
- Input validation
- Secure file handling
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- CORS configuration

This ensures the application is secure and provides helpful feedback to users."

## Demonstration (2-3 minutes)
"Let me demonstrate some key functionality:

1. Starting the server (show console output)
2. Creating a new course via API (using Postman or similar)
3. Uploading a course file
4. Processing a mock payment

This shows the complete flow from course creation to student enrollment."

## Conclusion (30 seconds)
"That concludes my overview of the CyberOide backend. This architecture provides:

- Scalability for growing user base
- Security for sensitive operations
- Flexibility for future feature additions
- Maintainability through clear code organization

Thank you for your time. I'm happy to answer any questions about implementation details or architectural decisions."

## Technical Notes (not for video - personal reminders)

- Show actual code for key components
- Have Postman ready for API demonstrations
- Prepare MongoDB sample data for demonstration
- Have environment variables configured
- Demonstrate error handling with example invalid requests
